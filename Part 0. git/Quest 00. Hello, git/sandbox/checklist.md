### Why need version control?

VCS allows developers track the history of changes, so we can run tests, fix bugs and write new code without any concern of breaking existing codebase.

### What are the benefits of using Git?

* It helps visualize the history of a project.
* It encourages collaboration of developers.

### Git commands

* `git clone` creates a local copy of an existing repository.
* `git add` stages a change. Staging is a prior step of committing.
* `git commit` saves changes staged by `git add`.
* `git push` updates the remote repository with local commits to a branch.
* `git pull` updates local copy with remote repository.
* `git branch` shows branches of the repository.
* `git stash`
